    <string name="scj_built">The SC Johnson Administration Building, designed\nby Frank Lloyd Wright in 1936</string>
    <string name="scj_desc">Far outside the corridors of high-tech industry and startup spaces, the SC Johnson company headquarters in Racine, Wisconsin, still provides a dashing vision of the modern American workplace, despite having recently celebrated its 75th anniversary. The SC Johnson Administration Building, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in 1936, eschews business clichés: workers are greeted by a streamlined, muscular exterior made from ribbons of glass and brick, more campus than corporate, before entering a light-filled interior, with rows of organic, curved columns creating an abstract forest surrounding the secretary pool. The 15-story Research Tower, completed in 1950, was built on a "taproot" system. A core of elevators, heating, and ductwork formed a spine at the center on the tower, supported by a foundation sunk 54-feet-deep into the ground. Disc-shaped mezzanines branched off the core, alternating with full sized, 40-foot wide floors. Walls of horizontal Pyrex tubes, the same used in the Administration Building, let in sunlight but block the view. The effect is of a tree enclosed in glass.</string>
    <string name="wingspread_built">Wingspread designed for SC Johnson owner\nHerbert Fisk Johnson, Jr. in 1936</string>
    <string name="wingspread_desc">A private residence Wright designed for SC Johnson owner Herbert Fisk Johnson, Jr. in 1936, Wingspread lives up to its names, a low-slung streamlined brick home with four wings spreading across the property. The central living room, a dome-shaped room, features a 30-foot-tall vertical fireplace and original furniture designed by Wright. Considered the last of the Prairie Houses, it’s filled with unique touches, including a dramatic “Romeo and Juliet” balcony that cantilevers over the landscape and a crow’s nest lookout built above the home, a favorite play place for the Johnson children.</string>
    <string name="monona_terrace_built">Monona Terrace completed in 1997</string>
    <string name="monona_terrace_desc">A sprawling, curved convention center on the shores of Lake Monona in Madison, this building was a posthumous addition to the Wright canon, rejected by officials during the architect’s lifetime, but finally approved via a referendum put local voters in the early ‘90s. The curvilinear “dream civic center,” which recalls the shape of the Guggenheim, was first proposed by Wright in 1938, and was a project he constantly altered and updated throughout his life. His former apprentice Anthony Puttnam would finish the designs for the interior before it was finally completed in 1997.</string>
    <string name="meeting_house_built">A landmark in church architecture from 1951</string>
    <string name="meeting_house_desc">A landmark in church architecture from 1951, Wright’s ship-like design for the First Unitarian Society, with a sharp prow jutting out from the earth towards the sky, offers a sense of transcendence, one he would often enjoy as a member of the congregation. His extensive use of copper and glass throughout the building provide a timeless feel to the unorthodox house of worship.</string>
    <string name="german_warehouse_built">A.D. German Warehouse built in 1921</string>
    <string name="german_warehouse_desc">A small brick structure used by a local commodity wholesaler, Albert Dell German, this warehouse, finished in 1921, features an elaborate Mayan Revival exterior. Built in the town of Richland Center, where Wright was born, this offers a rare example of a project the architect designed in the late 1910’s that’s still standing.</string>
    <string name="visitor_center_sub">Wright’s longtime home and studio</string>
    <string name="visitor_center_desc">This massive red brick and concrete building would be impressive in any setting; it is especially so in the small Wisconsin town where Wright was born. Designed in 1915 and constructed between 1917 and 1921 for a local commodity wholesaler, Albert D. German, the four-story warehouse was subsequently used to store sugar, flour, coffee, tobacco and other staples. In the 1970s it was modified to accommodate a gift shop and small theater on the first floor, and an exhibition of large photo murals which illustrate Wright\'s architectural work on the second floor. The Warehouse is one of only a few major public buildings designed by Wright during the mid-teens that were actually constructed. With the demolition of Midway Gardens in Chicago and the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo, it has become the only extant example from that decade in which he employed sculptural ornamentation so extensively. The elaborate cast concrete frieze of repeated geometric motifs surrounding the upper portion of the Warehouse foreshadows Wright\'s even more extensive integration of structure and ornament in the concrete block residences he designed in the 1920s.</string>
    <string name="built_homes_built">Variously built between 1915 and 1917</string>
    <string name="built_homes_desc">In a 1901 speech entitled, "The Art and Craft of the Machine," Wright outlined his vision of affordable housing. He asserted that the home would have to go to the factory, instead of the skilled labor coming to the building site. Between 1915 and 1917 Wright designed a series of standardized "system-built" homes, known today as the American System-Built Homes. By system-built, he did not mean pre-fabrication off-site, but rather a system that involved cutting the lumber and other materials in a mill or factory, then bringing them to the site for assembly. This system would save material waste and a substantial fraction of the wages paid to skilled tradesmen. Wright produced more than 900 working drawings and sketches of various designs for the system. Six examples were constructed, still standing, on West Burnham Street and Layton Boulevard in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Other examples were constructed on scattered sites throughout the Midwest with a few yet to be discovered.</string>
    <string name="valley_school_built">Built in 1957 for the children of Wyoming Valley</string>
    <string name="valley_school_desc">Wyoming Valley School Cultural Arts Center is a nonprofit organization that promotes the arts and culture of the surrounding region by opening the dynamic architecture of Wyoming Valley School to provide incomparable spaces for workshops, performances, lectures, and exhibits for all ages. It also offers space for private functions such as weddings, banquets, business meetings, or other events. Its mission is to maintain and preserve this architectural gem for the continued benefit of and use by the community.
